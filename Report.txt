Some of the issues I encountered while approaching this problem were as follows:
1.	Building Maven project. I haven’t developed a maven project before this, and had to understand the idea behind Maven.
2.	The problem was unique in the sense, it had a LET expression. Which required some additional thinking. (Recursive calls)
3.	Boundary condition checks. Since the application will take only integer values. Any value not in the range {Integer.MIN_VALUE …. Integer.MAX_VALUE} were immediately rejected.
4.	Checking for the expression integrity. Parenthesis should be balanced.
5.	Only integer values were allowed in the calculator. Removed decimal points.
6.	Another interesting issue was regarding negative numbers. Had to add additional condition for the same.

Build Notes:
Open command prompt navigate to the respective file location and type the following command
C:\User\Desktop\..\Coverity_Calculator> java -jar Calculator.jar
Expression> add(10,29)
Output = 39
Expression> let(a,let(b,5,add(b,10)),mult(a,div(10,2)))
Output = 75
Expression> quit

Note: Type quit to exit the application.
